## Background: Traditional "Prosthetic" AI Agent Mode is Outdated

Traditional AI mode (Agent 1.0) relies on Function Calling, Tools, MCP-Servers, Workflows and various plugin clients. Not only is the threshold high and cost high, but it also heavily depends on developer ecosystem. It's difficult for these external "prosthetics" to collaborate, and model-generated code is also limited to cloud sandboxes, unable to truly access the environment, resulting in limited AI action capabilities.

We urgently need a brand new paradigm to break this deadlock, achieve deep connection between AI and environment, truly unleash its native execution potential, and move towards the AI Think Do era.

## New Paradigm Debuts: Python-use = LLM + Python Interpreter

Python-Use is a new intelligent execution paradigm oriented towards task results. It builds a complete closed-loop process of "task → plan → code → execute → feedback" by deeply combining large models with Python interpreter.

Although this paradigm theoretically supports any programming language, we chose Python because it possesses:

- Powerful ecosystem, covering multiple dimensions such as data processing, system control, automation, AI, etc.;
- Concise syntax and high interpretability, making it easy for models to generate and debug;
- Models have high familiarity and calling efficiency with Python natively.

This gives models two key capabilities:

- **API Calling**: Models automatically write and execute Python code to call APIs, achieving inter-service communication;
- **Packages Calling**: Models autonomously select and call rich libraries in Python ecosystem, achieving universal task orchestration.

Users only need to provide simple API Keys or task descriptions, and models can automatically complete the entire process without toolchain configuration or plugin access, completely 摆脱 ing the tediousness of traditional Workflow and Function Calling.

Special emphasis: **Python-Use is not a "code generation tool" or "intelligent IDE"**, but a task-driven, results-oriented AI Agent.

For users, Python-Use is an intelligent agent system of "describe task → automatic completion → direct result return":

- Users don't need to master any programming knowledge;
- Models automatically complete understanding, planning, programming, debugging and result generation;
- Automatically fix bugs, continuously optimize solutions, ensuring high-quality task completion.

Code is just the means for models to achieve goals, ultimately delivering task completion results, not intermediate code processes.

## Technical Proposition: No Agents, Code is Agent

Python-Use opens a brand new intelligent action path: **No Agents、No MCP、No Workflow、No Clients...**

It abandons traditional AI's dependence on external tools, protocols, and execution layers, instead letting models use code to directly control the environment. We call this: **No Agents，Code is Agent**.

With Python, models can complete the following capabilities:

- **Python use Data**: Operate and analyze data
- **Python use Browser**: Browser automation
- **Python use Computer**: File system and local environment control
- **Python use IOT**: Device interaction and system integration
- **...**
- **Python use Anything**: Code leads to everything

This paradigm also means:

- **No MCP**: No need for unified protocols, code is protocol, code is standard;
- **No Workflow**: No need for preset processes, models autonomously plan execution;
- **No Tools**: No longer rely on plugin registration, models directly call ecosystem tools;
- **No Agents**: No need for external agents, models directly complete tasks through code.

It truly establishes a universal communication bridge between LLM and real environment, unleashing the model's execution and action potential.

## Unified Entry: No Clients, Only AiPy

AI execution no longer needs complex clients and shell applications. Users only need to run one Python environment: **AiPy**.

- **Unified Terminal**: All interactions return to Python interpreter
- **Minimal Path**: No need to install multiple Agents or plugins, unified entry, consistent experience
- **AiPy**: https://www.aipy.app/

## Mode Upgrade: AI ThinkDo = True Unity of Knowledge and Action

- **Task**: Users express intentions in natural language;
- **Plan**: Models automatically decompose and plan execution paths;
- **Code**: Generate optimal Python solutions;
- **Execute**: Directly interact with real environment and complete actions;
- **Feedback**: Get results, analyze deviations, automatically adjust.

Models possess full-process capabilities from cognition to action, from planning to reflection, no longer relying on external Agents, truly unleashing AI autonomous action power.

## Self-Evolution: Multi-Model Capability Fusion

AI evolution is no longer limited to language models, but moving towards multimodal, multi-capability fusion.

- Fuse vision models, achieving image and video understanding;
- Fuse voice models, achieving auditory input and voice output;
- Fuse expert models, enhancing professional knowledge processing capabilities;
- All capabilities are uniformly scheduled by model center, self-driven, self-feedback, self-evolution.

This is the transition path from "conversational agent" to "unified intelligent agent", moving towards true AGI.

## Vision: Liberate AI Towards AGI

Python-Use is not only a technical solution, but also a future-oriented AI philosophy and practice path:

**The Model is the Product → The Model is the Agent → No Agents, Code is Agent → Just Python-use → Freedom AI（AGI）**

It lets AI move from "only talking" to "actively executing", from relying on tools to independently completing, truly unleashing the intelligent productivity of large models, moving towards general intelligence.

Join us now, let AI awaken from constraints, truly unleash execution power, integrate into the world, and create value!

**The real general AI Agent is NO Agents!**

**No Agents, Just Python-use！**
